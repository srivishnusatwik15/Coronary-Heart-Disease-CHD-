# Coronary-Heart-Disease-CHD

Heart Disease prediction using Machine Learning

This assignment focuses on understanding and comparing the performance of different machine learning models for predicting whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD) based on a given dataset. You will analyse Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree,  KNN and other relevant techniques.

Contrast the performance of the three models:

Discuss strengths and weaknesses of  Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree,  KNN  for predicting Heart Disease.

Identify the most suitable model for the task based on accuracy and efficiency.

The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes. Variables Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral and medical risk factors.
